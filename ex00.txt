In this exercise, you will need to interact with HeadHunter API to parse some information about vacancies. In order to do this, you will need to understand how both curl
and HeadHunter API work.
Write a shell script that:
• gets as an argument name of a vacancy ‘data scientist’ (some other exercises will
be based on it)
• downloads information about the first 20 vacancies corresponding to the search
parameters
• stores it in a file with the name hh.json.
The result in the file must be formatted in the way that each field is placed on a
different line
Your script must be executable. The interpreter to use is /bin/sh. Put your script in
the ex00 folder in the root of your repository as well as your result of parsing..
